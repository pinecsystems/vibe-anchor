# vibe-anchor

A local-first project memory and intent anchor for agentic coding.

## What is this?

When coding with AI agents, context drifts.
Decisions get forgotten. Constraints get ignored. The “vibe” of the project slowly erodes.

**Vibe Anchor** is a lightweight, local-first tool that preserves project intent, decisions, and constraints so AI-assisted and agentic workflows stay aligned over time.

Built for solo builders who want more flow and less chaos.

---

## Why Vibe Anchor?

Agentic coding works best when:
- project intent is persistent
- decisions are remembered
- constraints are respected

Vibe Anchor acts as a single source of truth that agents can reference at any time.

No cloud. No accounts. Just local project memory.

---

## Core Features (MVP)

- Initialize a project intent file
- Log decisions, constraints, and notes
- Inject project context into AI agents
- Local-first storage (YAML / SQLite)

## Quick Start (planned)

```bash
vibe init
vibe note "Keep the system lightweight and local-first"
vibe inject
